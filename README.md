This GitHub repository houses an extensive dataset comprising 1900 virtual football match results. Our objective is to conduct in-depth analysis and develop predictive models to derive meaningful insights from this data. Through rigorous examination of patterns and factors influencing match outcomes, we aim to construct robust predictive algorithms for virtual football. Dive into our repository to explore the data, methodologies, and findings driving our predictive modeling endeavors in the realm of virtual sports.
